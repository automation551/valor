-king of the hill bot
4 flags per hill
map laid out so you can't grab all 4 flags in one sweep (like dsb)
one hill marked as active using lvz
once you control all 4 flags you own the hill (more lvz, arena message)
you must lose all 4 flags before you lose the hill
1 point per second, awarded when you lose the hill
active hill changes every minute and starts off as neutral

lvz: who owns the hill, one for each team and a nuetral one
