bullets
so a ship has a gun
guns fire bullets
bullets are entities that collide with walls (possibly bouncing or being absorbed)
when they collide with a ship, they deal damage to it
if their energy drops below zero, they die.
bullets cannot harm your own ship or your teammates, but bombs nearby can kill your teammates and drain your energy bt not kill you.

guns have three levels, 1, 2, 3, in increasing damage amount. these correspond to the bullet colors red yellow blue. guns  can be "multi" meaning they shoot 3 bullets at a time. bullets can bounce with an upgrade.

there is a bullet sprite sheet
row 0-4 is non-bouncy
row 5-9 is bouncy
