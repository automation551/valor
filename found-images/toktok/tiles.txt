...I discovered more usless but cool crap for my map editor (which died a month ago, but Im bringing it back).

well, this time I discoved "extra" tiles in continuum, most of them are usless but a few are cool. yea, I'll just describe them now...
(Note: when I say "Items", I mean decoys, bullets, bombs, shrap, burst, and power balls, but not thors)

Tile: Description
191: Invisible on screen, Visible on radar, Ships can go through them, Items bounce off it, Thors go through it. (if you "launch" an item while in it, the item will float suspended in space)
192-215: Invisible on screen, Visible on radar, Solid block (like any other tile)
216: a small asteroid, eveyone already knows about this...
217: a medium asteroid, everyone alreay knows about this...
218: another small asteroid, just the same as the other one, accept the gfx's are alittle diffrent
219: a spacestation, everyone knows about this...
220: a wormhole, everyone knows about this...
221-240: Invisible on screen, Visible on radar, Solid block (like any other tile)
241: Invisible on screen, Visible on radar, Ship can go through it but Items dissapear when they touch it.
242: Invisible on screen, Invisible on radar, Warps your ship on contact, items bounce off it, Thors dissapear on contact (!)
243-251: Invisible on screen, Invisible on radar, Solid block (like any other tile)
252: Visible on screen (Animated NME door), Invisible on radar, Items go through it, your ship gets warped after a random amount of time (0-2 seconds) while floating on it.
253: Visible on screen (Animated Team door), Invisible on radar, Items go through it, so does your ship.
254: Invisible on screen, Invisible on radar, Items go through it, So does your ship. idk what its used for, but it seems you cant door while on/near it.
255: Visible On screen (Animated Green Prize), Invisible on radar, Items go through it, So does your Ship. This is a green, but it doesent show up on radar, and no matter how many times you fly over it, you will never pick it up, ever.


as you can see, most of these tiles have great usability, I especially like tile 242 becasue you can make a flagging base that thors will not be able to get in.

I have the map Here if you want to test it out yourself, but you cant open it up in ssme becasue of a "Tile ID out of range" error.

Firstly, I must say this was all Overburn's work, no credit to me I am simply copying and pasting what he posted in the TW forums a few months ago. Everything between the underscores is written by Overburn.

I am sure many of you will find this is a pretty important and potentially revolutionary find:

__________________________

I must say some of these tiles are potentially extremely useful. The only current problem is the lack of editor support for them, but Overburn made a tile replacer tool which means you can make a map and then change all tiles of a certain TileID to another TileID but once that's done, it is unopenable in SSME.

He also discovered it's possible to place tiles on top of one another. I experimented with this (using hex editting) and you can make a Wormhole completly covered in Tile 254 which is invisible on screen and on radar, and upon sucking you in, doesn't warp you, just flings you out.

I would link you to his TileReplacer tool but it's a dead link. I'll pm him and edit this when I've got a new link to it.

New Special Tiles Report.
Version 1 - Revision 1


Report errors and new findings to Arnk Dylie <orbfighter at dotsomething dot net>
If you want to copy this file, go ahead. Credit is appreciated in such a case.

Apologies for any typos and spelling errors. No apologies for sentence fragments.


*****

These tiles are not part of the standard tile set. Their functionality was discovered recently.
SSME will not read or create maps with these tiles. To get these tiles, you must use an editor
that will use these tile IDs.

As with any tile, you may not lay mines or bricks on top of these tiles.



ID #191 - Ships fly through this wall
- Visible on radar.
- Ships fly through these tiles.
- Non-thor Weapons and powerballs do not fly through, they will either bounce or detonate.
  Weapons fired inside these tiles will either detonate (if they're a bomb,)
   or float in place until they expire.
- Tile is invisible.


ID #220 - Wormholes
- Wormholes. These are not new. However, if you place this tile and then other tiles
   directly below and to the right of it, the wormhole will no longer have a warping effect.
- Visible on radar.
- Weapons are absorbed on these tiles.

ID #241 - Weapons disappear
- Visible on radar.
- Ships fly through these tiles.
- Weapons that touch this tile disappear (they will NOT detonate or make any other sort of
   destruction effect, just disappear.) Thors are not affected by this tile, however.
- Tile is invisible.


ID #242 - Autowarp, Anti-thor.
- Invisible on radar.
- Ships will be warped upon flying onto this tile (as if they pressed the warp key, so it makes
   the warp noise.)
- Thors will disappear upon flying onto this tile (again, not destruction effect.)
- Tile is invisible.


ID #243-#251 - Phantom wall
- Invisible on radar.
- This acts exactly like a wall, just you can't see it on radar.
- Tile is invisible.


ID #252 - Enemy Brick
- Invisible on radar.
- Looks like an enemy brick, anyone can fly on it.
- This tile acts kind of like a door. If you fly on it, you will be warped after a few seconds.
- If you place a portal on it and then warp back, you will be warped back to the spawn point instantly.


ID #253 - Team Brick
- Looks like a teammate's brick.
- Ships fly through it.
- No apparent special effect.
- Invisible on radar.


ID #254 - Improved Anti-mining Anti-bricking
- Tile is invisible. Also invisible on radar.
- This allows you to create mine-free zones without making the map look bad on radar.


ID #255 - Phantom Green
- Tile looks like a green.
- It cannot be picked up and will not grant any prize for flying over it.
- Invisible on radar.
