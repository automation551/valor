; where <number> is 0-255, <x tiles>,<y tiles>,<anim period> are optional parameters
; that are used to specify animated images. if <x tiles> and <y tiles> present, 
; image file is treated as collection of x*y images. <anim period> is given in 1/100th

; [mapobjects] section specifies object locations on map. Syntax of mapobject 
; specification is following
; <x coord>,<y coord>,<image>,<layer>,<mode>,<display time>,<object id> where
; <x coord> and <y coord> are where upper left pixel of the image is placed on map. 
; center is 8192,8192, top left 0,0, bottom right 16384,16384. <image> specifies what
; images is displayed from [objectimages] section and has format IMAGE<number>.
; <layer> is one of following: BelowAll,AfterBackground,AfterTiles,AfterWeapons,

; <x coord> and <y coord> are coordinates on screen with following additions:

; as normal screen coordinates) and negative numbers (without C prefix) are relative to
; bottom right screen corner
