- make a directory within src for a related set of modules.
- in that directory, put all your source, and one .mk file.
- use one .c file for each module, and have the name of the .c file match the name of the module.
- create a .mk file in the directory. use turf.mk as an example. the basic structure is: to put modules foo1, foo2, and foo3, defined in foo1.c, foo2.c, and foo3
02/07/05 9:16 AM Grelminar: .c, into foos.so, do this:

  # foos.mk
  foos_mods = foo1 foo2 foo3
  $(eval $(call dl_template,foos))

if you need special flags for the link command (to link against zlib, for example), set foos_libs to those flags.
- run "make deps" from the src directory to pick up the new .mk file, then run "make", and your module should be compiled, linked, and installed into the bin directory.
