We have a:
message queue
  serialize/deserialize data
  enqueue messages to/from server
    sync (connected, join, part)
    async (gamestate, keys)

transport
  has a raw device (like "WebSocket")
  ??
  it's like a bridge between the game and the networking device? at least for the server it is

there are a bunch of events we're interested in, and it's somewhat tied to the game loop.

Need to have a delay play buffer thing like that gafferongames. Need to test that inputs received will result in the same state later between server and client. To do that we can make a recording of moving around and shooting stuff, and then pausing the simulation to check on the final state of the ship(s).
