the Scene class
the game tree
the viewport

scene red list: a list of all of the objects that are visible last frame
scene black list: a list to hold the visible objects this frame

on update, all objects in the viewport are found, added to the stage (if not added already), positions updated, and copied to the "black list", meaning they are visible this frame

on invalidate, any objects remaining in the red list are removed from the stage, the list is cleared and red & black swap.

the Simulator class
simulatable list
the game tree

on "simulate" all objects are simulated against the time delta and collision checked/resolved
-> object simulate()
on collision
-> object collide(object)

add: object is added to the game to be simulated
ships, bullets, bombs, anything that moves and needs to check collision

remove: object is removed from being simulated (should also be removed from scene and game graph)
